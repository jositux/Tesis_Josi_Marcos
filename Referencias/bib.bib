@phdthesis{PerezGarcia2014,
abstract = {This final project is framed within the context of co-design. The concept of co-design can be defined as “a process of creative collaboration between designers and people, which have no previous training in design, in order to solve meaningful problems”. Within this context, there exists a recent trend of development of technological tools that improve the process of design. However, the support of the co-design processes carried out in a distributed and/or synchronous manner presents a challenge to be solved.
 It is often necessary that this process of co-design can be performed in a distributed manner in order to facilitate the participation of people from different locations. Similarly, there is a need to obtain design resources remotely. In particular, the participants may want to get multimedia resources even if these are not in the same design space. Accordingly, it is necessary to assist the co-design process in a distributed manner and to ensure that, in both cases, there is a need of coordination for the data access.
 In order to address these requirements, this final project provides a technological environment that supports the co-design process. In particular, the contributions of this project are related to both the assistance of building affinity diagrams in a distributed manner and collecting multimedia information remotely. With this purpose, this project extends the functionality of a design tool called ColDes by allowing to create a new type of design room that support the creation of affinity diagrams in a distributed manner. The participants can now create and share design ideas by adding information item related to the problem established in the design process. These information items can be organized into groups of similar ideas that are meaningful to the resolution of the problem. In this way, it is obtained a visual representation of the first draft of the design solution. Aiming at allowing obtaining multimedia resources remotely, it has been developed a mobile application. The participants can take photos and videos from anywhere and add them to the affinity diagram. These resources can be used to reinforce ideas of the affinity diagram, since it is possible to associate them to the information items created in the affinity diagram workspace of ColDes.
 To conclude, all the information stored in the ColDes system has been made persistent. The participants can save an affinity diagram at any time, and recover it later to continue the design. They, therefore, can perform their work in an affinity diagram in a discontinued manner. Since several users can simultaneously access the system resources, some collaboration policies have been introduced to ensure the consistency of the data in cases where the process is performed in a distributed and/or synchronous manner.},

abstract = {This paper presents a collaborative 3D workspace that makes use of newly developed interaction techniques for synchronous distributed product design reviews. These new techniques were developed to enhance collaboration in regard to shared objects and shared workspaces. The requirements for such collaboration were determined through literature review and an observational study. An augmented reality based collaborative design workspace was developed in which the interaction techniques, the use of Sync-turntables and Virtual Shadows, were created to support shared manipulation, awareness of the actions of remote participants, and tele-presence. The Sync-turntable is a rotating synchronized table that provides intuitive physical representation of shared virtual 3D models. It also provides a physical cue of the remote participants' manipulation. Virtual Shadows project body and hand silhouettes of remote participants which provides natural and continuous awareness of the location, gestures and pointing of collaborators. A lab-based user study was conducted, and the results show that these interaction techniques support awareness of general pointing and facilitate discussion in 3D product design reviews. The proposed workspace and interaction techniques are expected to facilitate more natural communication and to increase the efficiency of collaboration on virtual 3D models between distributed participants (designer-designer, engineer, or modeler) in collaborative design environments.},

But in today's web-driven reality, orchestrating the entire design from the get-go no longer works. This hands-on book demonstrates Lean UX, a deeply collaborative and cross-functional process that lets you strip away heavy deliverables in favor of building shared understanding with the rest of the product team. Lean UX is the evolution of product design; refined through the real-world experiences of companies large and small, these practices and principles help you maintain daily, continuous engagement with your teammates, rather than work in isolation.},

abstract = {It has long been assumed that new product innovations are typically developed by product manufacturers, an assumption that has inevitably had a major impact on innovation-related research and activities ranging from how firms organize their research and development to how governments measure innovation. In this synthesis of his seminal research, von Hippel challenges that basic assumption and demonstrates that innovation occurs in different places in different industries. Presenting a series of studies showing that end-users, material suppliers, and others are the typical sources of innovation in some fields, von Hippel explores why this variation in the "functional" sources of innovation occurs and how it might be predicted. He also proposes and tests some implications of replacing a manufacturer-as-innovator assumption with a view of the innovation process as predictably distributed across users, manufacturers, and suppliers. Innovation, he argues, will take place where there is greatest economic benefit to the innovator.},

@article{Ruiz,
abstract = {A sole company cannot accomplish the full design of most products (automobiles, aeroplanes or space vehicles), even if the company is a big one. Engineering suppliers are needed to develop the full product. Product development is understood as a continuous process of knowledge collection over a set of tasks, and their relationships. Those tasks must be performed for obtaining the information about how is the product, how must be manufactured, how must be used, how must be maintained, how must be recycled, and whatever other aspect related to the product lifecycle. However, talking about industrial products, design cannot be considered as isolated of other important enterprise issues, such as market demand, standards and rules, buying requirements, available manufacturing processes and maintenance service. Design is a critical task in the product development process, because it provides with all the information defining next steps to the final manufacturing of the product. It can be stated that the maximum efficiency is achieved upon an adequate process supported by design engineering techniques and tools. Thus, the simultaneous combination of process and tools results in enhanced product final competitiveness. To use a proven methodology, and specific tools, in a Collaborative Engineering environment is becoming a fundamental issue, that allows for practical development of highly complex projects, from technical to organisational point of view.},

abstract = {This paper discusses parametric design systems as a generative tool in architectural design. Parametric tools are algorithmically based, and therefore offer increased computational control over design geometry during design activity. Their adaptability and responsiveness to changingdesign criteria and requirements make parametric models especially useful for design exploration in complex and dynamic design settings. In performance based design, parametric control of form is particularlyvaluable, such that they allow the integration of performance analysis into design synthesis. However, parametric systems are often incorrectly mistaken as an emerging architectural style rather than a computational method, ascribing it a false skin-deep character that overshadows its true merits. Moreover, parametric models come with a price, posing limitations regarding representational flexibility and design complexity, which hindereffective design exploration. A critical awareness on both the potentials and limitations of parametric systems is therefore critical in their effective use during design.},

In this new model, the single-page Web interface is composed of individual components which can be updated/replaced independently.

Gaining an understanding of the navigational model and user interface structure of the source application is the first step in the migration process. In this paper, we explore how reverse engineering techniques can help analyze classic Web applications for this purpose. Our approach, using a schema-based clustering technique, extracts a navigational model of Web applications, and identifies candidate user interface components to be migrated to a single-page Ajax interface.
